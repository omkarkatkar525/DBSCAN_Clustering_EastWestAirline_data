1.Hierarchical Clustering

2.K-Means Clustering

3.Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)

## DBSCAN:
```sh
It works based on density clustering mwthod that discovers cluster of non sperical shape.

Radius of neighborhood (R):The Size and Borders of each neighborhood.

Min no. of neighborhood: To form Cluster it should conatai at least this no. of points.
It is density Thershold.

```

## Data Used :
```sh
EastWestAirlines: Airlines data to obtain optimum number of clusters.
```  
## Programming:
